## Commands

### Open Workspace

List and launch your workspaces. Simply search for a workspace and press Enter to open all its items.

### Quick Open

CLI-style quick launcher for instant access to any item across all your workspaces. Type to search and press Enter to open individual items without launching the entire workspace.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Build the extension: `pnpm build`
4. Import into Raycast

**Note**: This extension uses `pnpm` as the package manager. The `ray lint` command may show warnings about missing `package-lock.json`, which is expected since we use `pnpm-lock.yaml` instead. The extension builds and works correctly.
